## Hi there 👋

I’m Utkarsh, a Backend Python Engineer focused on building scalable, secure, and maintainable backend systems.

I primarily work on API-driven architectures, database-backed applications, and background processing systems. My day-to-day work involves designing REST APIs, optimizing database queries, handling async workloads, and deploying services to cloud environments.
