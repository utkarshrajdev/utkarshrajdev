## Hi there 👋

I’m **Utkarsh**, a Backend Python Engineer focused on building **scalable, secure, and high-performance systems**.

I have **2+ years of hands-on experience** working with Python and Django, optimizing APIs with **Redis caching** and **PostgreSQL indexing**, implementing **RBAC-based security**, and deploying production systems using **Docker and AWS**.  
At **Adventure Sports Cover 360**, I worked on performance tuning and system hardening. Previously at **Praedico Global**, I implemented **JWT/OAuth2 authentication** and built **real-time dashboards** using WebSockets.

### 🚀 Projects
- **Job Portal** – Django + Elasticsearch for fast, relevant job search  
- **Face Recognition Attendance System** – OpenCV + scikit-learn (~95% accuracy)

### 🛠 Tech Stack
**Python, Django, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, AWS, Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes**

### 📈 Highlights
- **500+ DSA problems solved** on LeetCode, achieved Knight rank.
- **2nd place** in a Hackathon  
- Strong focus on **performance, security, and clean backend architecture**

I value **practical engineering over buzzwords** and prefer systems that scale without drama.
